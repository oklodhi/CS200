2) 	FOR LOOP:

			n++;
		}

Initialization: initialized n in side the () in the FOR loop vs initialized n before the WHILE loop began
Looping Condition: the condition is almost similar on both; inside the (). Both loop until n <= 20.
Code After Each Cycle: the n = n * 2 is called within the () of the FOR vs n = n * 2 is called in code block { } of the WHILE loop.
